//     Time & Space Complexity
// Time Complexity: O(V‚ãÖE)
// The outer loop runs V‚àí1 times.
// The inner loop iterates over all E edges.So, total time complexity: O(VE). Space Complexity: O(V)
// We store only the distance array dis, which takes 
// O(V) space.


// Why do we run the relaxation process for  V‚àí1 times?  there are linear graph like this 1->2->3->4->5  for this distance array to befilled compelety with no negative we have to go through n-1 cycles
// A shortest path in a graph contains at most V‚àí1 edges (in the worst case).
// If a path has more than V‚àí1 edges, it must contain a cycle.

// Since Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work with negative weights, we use Bellman-Ford to ensure all possible shorter paths are checked.
// Why do we perform an additional ùëâ
// Vth iteration to detect negative cycles?
// After V‚àí1 

// relaxations, all shortest paths (without cycles) are computed.
// If we can still relax an edge, it means there exists a negative weight cycle.
// This is because a negative cycle allows us to infinitely decrease the path weight.
// If such an edge relaxation is possible, we return {-1} to indicate negative cycle presence.


// Why does Bellman-Ford only work for Directed Graphs, not Undirected Graphs?
// In undirected graphs, a negative weight cycle can be counted twice (once in each direction), causing incorrect results.
// Example:
// 1 --- (-5) --- 2
// This cycle would be relaxed twice, making Bellman-Ford unstable for undirected graphs.
// Solution: If using Bellman-Ford on an undirected graph, convert it to a directed graph by adding directed edges (u ‚Üí v and v ‚Üí u) carefully.


// Key Takeaways
// ‚úÖ Works for graphs with negative weights
// ‚úÖ Detects negative weight cycles
// ‚úÖ Best for single-source shortest path problems when negative weights exist
// ‚ùå Slower than Dijkstra (O(VE) vs. O((V+E)logV))
// ‚ùå Does not work correctly for undirected graphs with negative weights
